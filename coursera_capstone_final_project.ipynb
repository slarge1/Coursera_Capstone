    "<h2> Introduction </h2>\n",
    "<p>Toronto is the most populous city in Canada with a recorded population of nearly 3 million people. It is the capital city of the province of Ontario and is widely recognised as one of the most multicultural and cosmopolitan cities in the world. As an international centre of business, finance, arts and culture, Toronto is extremely popular with both tourists and residents alike. </p>\n",
    "<h3> Business Problem </h3>\n",
    "<p>My client is the chief executive officer (CEO) of a large retail clothing business. As a budding data scientist, my client has asked me to decide on the most suitable neighbourhood in Toronto to open a new store. My client has stressed that the key to retail success on the high street boils down to four factors; great products, attentive customer service, consistently high foot-fall, and convenient parking. </p>\n",
    "<p>While the products themselves and customer service are not my responsibility, I can leverage the Foursquare API to ensure that the recommended neighbourhoods have busy streets and nearby parking locations. Additionally, I will be clustering Toronto’s neighbourhoods by popular venues to determine which of them can be considered hot-spots for retail outlets and eateries. </p>\n",
    "\n",
    "<h2> The Data </h2>\n",
    "<h3> Required data </h3>\n",
    "<p>The following data will be required to provide an accurate recommendation to my client:</p>\n",
    "<ul>\n",
    "    <li>A list of Toronto’s neighbourhoods, with latitude and longitude coordinates, calculated by geopy’s Nominatim</li>\n",
    "    <li>A list of the most popular venues for each postal code region retrieved via the Foursquare API</li>\n",
    "    <li>A list of suitable car parks for each postal code region retrieved via the Foursquare API</li>\n",
    "    <li>A list of total population for each postal code region retrieved via Statistics Canada [1]\n",
    "</ul>\n",
    "<h3> Assumptions </h3>\n",
    "<p>There will be some assumptions made to keep this project relatively simple. Firstly, I am making the assumption that all postal-codes cover the same land area and hence population density will have a direct linear relationship with total population. Additionally, I am making the assumption that while total populations may have changed since this data was curated (2016), postal-code population sizes will be largely similar in relation to each other. Furthermore, it will be assumed all car parks retrieved from the Foursquare API are deemed suitable and that only one car park is required to meet the parking criteria outline in the first section.</p>"
